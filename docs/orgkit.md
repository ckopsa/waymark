# The org kit

An org is code-first: a thin directory of declarations that a seat
writes and the factory builds. Boot, conformance, onboarding and
clones all read this one shape. `orgkit/template/` is the starter
directory every org copies; `orgs/example/` is a filled copy, a tiny
two-kind org with one seat.

## The shape

```
orgs/<org>/
  deps.edn                 waymark10 and factorykit by local root
  src/<org>/org.clj        the module: resources, check-resources, domain
  src/<org>/kinds/*.clj    one defresource per kind, guards as defguard sentences
  resources/<org>/seed.edn what a fresh engine holds at boot
  README.md                what each file is
```

To start an org, copy `orgkit/template/` to `orgs/<org>/` and replace
every `myorg` with the org's name: the directories under `src/` and
`resources/`, the namespaces, the domain keyword and the seed. The
`deps.edn` roots are relative to `orgs/<org>/`, so a copy keeps them.
`clojure -M:check` in the org's directory runs the declaration gate,
and `factory10.orgkit-test` loads the template and the example.

## Naming rules

- The org name is the namespace root and the domain name: org
  `example` is `example.org`, `example.kinds.*`, `resources/example/`
  and the domain `:example`. It is snake_case: `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`.
- A kind name is the org's to choose, but it may not be one the
  engine already enrols (`job`, `member`, `grant`, `seat`, `ticket`
  and the rest of `waymark10.modules/inventory`): the registry holds
  one law per kind. That is why the example's work is a `work_order`.
- The module is `<org>.org`, and it declares `resources` (its kinds,
  stamped by `in-domain`) and `check-resources` (zero-arg, for the
  gate).

## The seed

`resources/<org>/seed.edn` is the demo seed's grammar
(`docs/spec-demo-clones.md` § 1), with an org's own sections beside
it:

- `:seed`, `:version` and `:org`, the org's name.
- `:domains`: each `{:name, :label}`; the first is the org's own. The
  first boot makes each a `domain` row through its create door, as the
  owner and before the seats: its charter is its `:charter` or its
  `:label`, its budget its `:budget_usd_per_week` or the factory's 3600.
- `:cast`: the members, as in the demo seed.
- `:seats`: each a factorykit seat template and its params,
  `{:template "mayor" :params {...}}`, or a whole seat map under
  `:seat` when no template walks the org's kinds.
- `:judgments`: each a factorykit judgment template and its params.
- `:steps`: the starting rows, each an ordinary create or invoke by a
  cast member, as in the demo seed.

The loader that walks it on a fresh engine is M1b's.

## What an org may not do

- No engine code: an org declares kinds, guards and its seed. A
  framework gap is a ticket against `waymark10`, not a workaround in
  the org.
- No new top-level deps beyond the kit: `deps.edn` names Clojure,
  waymark10 and factorykit and nothing else.
